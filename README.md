- ðŸ‘‹ I'm mainly a 3D artist, I have however delved into proramming formerly. I'm hoping to get back into the nitty gritty of python and SQL again.. and maybe other things within the realm of comp sci.
- I'm mainly interested in web scraping and 3d model integration within programs. Currently re-learning python and SQL again, with a bit of C# to the side.

- I'm deffo interested in collaboration work as well.
